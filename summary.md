# Introduction

In my Shiny app, other than my introduction I decided to include an interactive chart where users can select 3 countries and a time frame in years and view those countries' carbon dioxide emissions in a line graph. I chose to analyze this feature because it makes it the easiest for users to compare emissions to countries of their choosing and select a time frame that may be more relevant to them. In addition to my chart, I have answered 5 summary questions relevant to this dataset.

## Dataset
This dataset on carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions is collected and maintained by Our World in Data who's mission is to publish the "research and data to make progress against the world's largest problems", one of those problems being climate change. THe CO2 emission data is sourced from the Global Carbon Project and includes data on various emission rates (annual, per capita, cumulative, etc.). The greenhouse gas emission data is sourced from the CAIT Climate Data Explorer. This datset is updated reularly and at the very least, annually to stay up to date on the data it provides. One of the main limitations of this dataset are missing values. Some countries have data as early as 1750 however that is not the case for most countries. This means as data scientists we must recognize at what point is there filled in data for a certain country and to be sure to compare countries at similar time frames. Other than that, these datsets are sourced from reliable sources that update frequently.

## Questions
1. Which country has the highest average carbon dioxide emissions?
1. Which country has the highest average carbon dioxide emissions per capita?
1. Which country has the highest average growth in percentage of CO2 emissions from 1990-2020?
1. What is the average annual consumption based emissions of CO2 in America? How does that compare to the rest of the world?
1. What year did America have the highest total green house gas emissions?

## Summary
In response to the questions above, I found that China has the highest average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and Qatar has the highest average CO2 emissions per capita. To add on, Eritrea has the highest average growth in percentage of CO2 emissions from 1990-2020. In relation to America, the average annual consumption based emissions of CO2 is 5829.9 million tonnes. Compared to the rest of the world with an average annual consumption of 1090.1 million tonnes, over 5 times less than America. Lastly I found that America had the highest total green house gas emissions in the year 2000. 

# Conclusions 
From my visualization, I decided to focus on the United States carbon dioxide emissions per capita. I found that since the year 2000, there has been a steady decrease in emissions which can potentially be explained by the emergent discoveries in climate change at the time. This downward trend can also be found in many other countries such as Germany and Denmark. On the other end, countries in Asia such as China, South Korea, and Vietnam show a steady increase in emissions.
